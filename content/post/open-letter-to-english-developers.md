Hi you,

If you only speak English and don't think other languages might have more than 26 characters, then
this letter is for you. If you know it but you never struggled to use *special* characters because
of the language you speak, it is also for you.

Although many systems do handle other languages pretty correctly, many others simply do not. As this
letter will explain, many frustration points exist for both users and developers.

All languages are great, and none is superior to another. However, at the beginning of computer
times, having them all was pretty much impossible. All languages combined account for maybe millions
of glyphs and many ways to write them. Naturally, computer makers had to start by handling only
their own language. It turns out than American computers became prevalent and nowadays all
programming languages are English-based. Which is nice, it gives some kind of consistency to it all!

The thing is, one of the legacy of this
